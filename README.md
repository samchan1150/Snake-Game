The game is a JavaScript implementation of the classic Snake game played on a 20x20 grid. You control a snake that moves continuously across the grid, starting with three segments and initially moving to the right. Using the arrow keys, you can change the snake's direction—up, down, left, or right—but you cannot reverse its direction directly (for example, moving directly from left to right).

As the snake moves, food items appear randomly on the grid. When the snake's head reaches a food item, the snake grows by one segment, and your score increases by one point. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls of the grid or running into its own body. If the snake hits the edge of the grid or collides with itself, the game ends, and your final score is displayed. You can then choose to start a new game and try to achieve a higher score.
